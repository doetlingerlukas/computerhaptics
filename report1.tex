  \section*{Task 1}

  \section*{Task 2}

  As an initial step, the values returned by the magnetic sensor of the \textit{Haptik} were analysed to determine the highest one returned before flipping to zero. This value $m$ can be different for each device. In this case $m = 972$ was measured. Since the magnetic sensor records starting at zero after a full rotation, those flips, that occur after a full rotation, are represented by $f$. Using those variables, we can calculate the absolute position $p_{abs}$ with
  \begin{equation*}
    p_{abs} = \phi + (f * m)
  \end{equation*}
  where $\phi$ is the value returned by the magnetic sensor.

  \section*{Task 3}

  We can obtain the following graph by measuring the absolute positions at different degrees.

        ymin=-55, ymax=55,
        xtick={1000,2000,3000,4000,5000,6000,7000,8000},
        ytick={-50,-25,0,25,50},
        xtick pos=left,
        ytick pos=left,
      ]

      \addplot[ no marks ] coordinates { (0,-55) (8500,55) };

      \addplot[ cyan, only marks ] coordinates {
        (347,-50) (1060,-40) (1980,-30) (2670,-20) (3400,-10) (4200,0) (4960,10) (5870,20) (6500,30) (7110,40) (8060,50)
      };

  The blue dots represent the measure values. We can clearly see some imprecision, which is due to the imperfection of the motor-mount and the string itself.
