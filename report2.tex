  \section*{Task 1 - Spring}

  For this experiment, the absolute position $x_{user}$ was multiplied with the stiffness factor $f$ to calculate the Force. The following graph shows the output when moving the handle in one direction. The displayed results were generated with $f = 0.002$.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \begin{axis}[
        xlabel={$x_{user}$},
        ylabel={F},
        xmin=0, xmax=2300,
        ymin=0, ymax=4.50,
        xtick={500,1000,1500,2000},
        ytick={1,2,3,4},
        xtick pos=left,
        ytick pos=left,
      ]

        \addplot [ smooth, very thick, color=cyan ] table {res/measurements-2-1.txt};

      \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{figure}

  We can clearly see some outliers due to measurement imprecision, as the graph uses about 3000 coordinates.\\
  Increasing the stiffness resulted in the expected instability of the device, which started to show at $f = 0.008$. This can be noticed by the paddle bouncing from left to right without any interaction, due to imprecision of the \textit{Hapkit}. The high force moves the paddle beyond the zero position into the \textit{"opposite spring"}.
